# Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning techniques to analyze historical weather data and forecast future temperatures. The implementation is provided as a Jupyter notebook that walks through the entire process from data loading to prediction.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration of historical temperature data
- Comprehensive data visualization using Plotly
- Time series analysis of temperature trends
- Clustering analysis to identify temperature patterns
- Seasonal weather analysis
- Machine learning model development using Decision Tree Regressor
- Temperature forecasting for future months

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - plotly
  - scikit-learn
  - datetime

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas plotly scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook weather_forecasting.ipynb
   ```

## Dataset
The project uses a historical weather dataset containing monthly temperature readings over multiple years. The dataset should be named "Weather.csv" and placed in the same directory as the notebook.

## Project Structure
The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project goals and approach
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset and preparing it for analysis
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing temperature trends and patterns
4. **Clustering Analysis**: Using K-means to identify temperature clusters
5. **Seasonal Analysis**: Analyzing temperature patterns by season
6. **Machine Learning Model**: Building and training a Decision Tree Regressor
7. **Forecasting**: Predicting temperatures for future months
8. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential improvements

## How It Works
The project follows these steps:
1. Load historical temperature data
2. Transform the data into a suitable format for time series analysis
3. Visualize temperature trends over time
4. Perform clustering to identify temperature patterns
5. Analyze seasonal temperature variations
6. Train a Decision Tree Regressor model on the historical data
7. Use the trained model to forecast future temperatures

## Results
The model achieves a high RÂ² score, indicating good predictive performance. The forecasted temperatures for each month are presented in a table format at the end of the notebook.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional weather variables (humidity, pressure, etc.)
- Experiment with more advanced models (LSTM, Prophet, etc.)
- Add confidence intervals to forecasts
- Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation
